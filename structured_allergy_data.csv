Allergen-specific immunotherapy, administered by qualified specialists and using standardized extracts, is beneficial for individuals with ongoing symptoms. Insights from real-life data collected through mobile applications are enhancing understanding of AR types and their management. Future developments aim to improve recognition of complex overlapping conditions, utilize health technology evaluations, and promote patient-involved treatment decisions."

Such innovations are paving the way toward personalized medicine, aiming to optimize therapeutic outcomes and reduce the overall disease burden. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on the genetic, immunologic, and molecular mechanisms underlying psoriasis. The review emphasizes recent advances in targeted therapies underlining the potential for translational applications that address both cutaneous manifestations and systemic inflammation. It also explores global disparities in psoriasis care and the need for inclusive approaches that bridge disparities and promote equitable, innovative disease management strategies."

AD patients demonstrated a significant increase in circulating Th9 cell frequency (11.5 ± 0.3% vs. 5.0 ± 0.5%, p < 0.0001), PU.1 mRNA expression with an average 2.5-fold upregulation (p < 0.001), and elevated serum IL-9 concentrations (18.6 ± 6.3 pg/mL vs. 8.3 ± 1.9 pg/mL, p < 0.0001) compared to healthy controls. Stratified analysis revealed significant associations of PU.1 mRNA and IL-9 levels with rural residence, vitamin D deficiency, and peripheral eosinophilia (p < 0.05). Allergen sensitivity, as determined by skin prick testing, was positive in 50% of AD patients, and 66.7% exhibited elevated total serum IgE levels. Our findings underscore the involvement of the Th9/PU.1/IL-9 axis in the immunopathogenesis of AD. The observed upregulation of Th9 cell frequency, PU.1 expression, and IL-9 levels suggests a contributory role of Th9-mediated pathways in disease development and severity. These results provide a foundation for future studies investigating the dynamic crosstalk between Th9 cells, other immune cell subsets, and epidermal components, with the aim of identifying novel immunomodulatory targets for precision therapy in AD."

LDA has been less extensively studied in IIM, with the myositis disease activity assessment visual analog scales (MYOACT) being the only measure applied to DM. Remission rates varied widely, with stricter criteria yielding lower rates. Factors associated with remission included younger age, early immunosuppressive treatment, non-severe muscle involvement, the absence of myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA), although some studies reported positivity for certain MSA were associated with remission. Conversely, remission was less likely for patients with PM, overlap myositis, and those positive for anti-TIF1-γ or Ku autoantibodies. Standardized remission criteria incorporating physician assessment, patient assessment, organ-specific parameters, laboratory assessments, and sustained remission duration are essential for harmonizing clinical and research evaluations in IIM.

Treatment strategies address underlying conditions by emphasizing lifestyle modifications and in some cases, pharmacological interventions. This review aims to comprehensively examine the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and management of acanthosis nigricans. AN is closely linked to insulin resistance, characterized by impaired cellular response to insulin, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Recognizing AN's clinical presentation is paramount for early diagnosis and appropriate management. Acanthosis Nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, thickened patches of skin, typically occurring in skin folds and creases. It can be a sign of an underlying health issue such as insulin resistance, obesity, hormonal disorders, or certain medications. Proper diagnosis and management of the underlying conditions are crucial. Treatment may involve addressing the underlying causes, lifestyle changes, and topical medications to improve the appearance of the skin. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a health care professional are essential for optimal management and to prevent complications."

The side effects of calcitonin therapy are mild and short-term: transient nausea and gastric discomfort were reported in 8 to 10 % of the patients, while facial flushing and skin hypersensitivity occurred in 2 to 5 %. The relatively low bioavailability of calcitonin in nasal formulations also limits its utility. Methodological limitations of the reviewed studies include variability in BMD (bone mineral density) assessment methods, potential selection bias, small sample sizes, and lack of blinding in some trials. Calcitonin enhances bone density at weekly dosages of more than 250 IU thereby lowering the risk of fractures. This literature review provides us with an understanding of the potential future applications of calcitonin nasal spray as an adjuvant for enhancing bone mineralization in patients with pathologies and fractures."

Immunophenotyping and cytokine production were investigated by flow cytometry; immunofluorescence of skin was studied using confocal microscopy. We observed oral application of dihydromyricetin significantly reduced the inflammatory parameters in both diseases. We also found that dihydromyricetin dose dependently reduced the percentage of IL17A producing T cell population and reduced the total expression of RORγt in diseased T cells. Furthermore, we also found stable and strong binding of dihydromyricetin- RORγt protein complex. Stability of protein-ligand complex was examined by MD simulation study. We suggest that dihydromyricetin alleviates scleroderma and dermatitis symptoms by regulating the RORγt pathway."

Aims This study aimed to evaluate the various etiologies of EN and determine the clinical, laboratory, and immunohistochemical predictors of chronicity. Methods We conducted a prospective hospital-based study between July 2022 and June 2024 at a tertiary care centre in Eastern India. Clinical and histopathologically confirmed cases of EN presenting within 2-3 days of onset, without prior treatment, were enrolled. A detailed clinical examination and laboratory investigations were performed during the initial visit, including immunohistochemical analysis of skin biopsies. The total number of T cells (CD3+), helper T cells (CD4+), cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), CD4:CD8 ratio, and NK (natural killer) cells (CD56+) were quantified per skin biopsy specimen using a standardised technique. Patients were treated at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients were monitored monthly for three months and categorised as either having ""Classic EN"" (lesions resolving within three months) or ""Chronic EN"" (lesions persisting beyond three months). Data collected at the initial visit were correlated between the two groups to identify potential predictors of chronicity. Results Out of 63 suspected cases, EN was confirmed in 41 patients, who were predominantly females (65.85%), with a median age of 49 years (Q1 - Q3: 32 - 57). Pulmonary tuberculosis was the most frequent underlying condition (n = 15, 36.59%), followed by sarcoidosis (n = 8, 19.51%) and rheumatoid arthritis (n = 6, 14.63%). Chronic EN was observed in 36.59% of cases, with significantly elevated baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p = 0.003) and Mantoux test readings (p = 0.002). Immunohistochemistry revealed higher CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56 levels in chronic EN cases (p < 0.05). Limitations The study's limitations include a small sample size and short follow-up duration. Multivariable analysis could not be performed due to the small sample size. Conclusion This study identified clinical and immunohistochemical markers associated with the chronicity of EN and highlighted pulmonary tuberculosis as the most common underlying cause. Elevated CRP levels, positive Mantoux test results, and increased expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD56 observed at baseline were linked to chronicity. The findings suggest the predominant role of T helper 1 (Th1) cell response and innate immunity in the pathogenesis of chronic EN lesions. Understanding these predictors and underlying aetiologies can help clinicians identify high-risk patients and tailor management accordingly."

Studies addressing PEG's allergenic potential were also reviewed, focusing on cutaneous reactions and rare anaphylactic events. Articles in English, published until June 2024, were included in this narrative review. PEG's emollient and humectant properties make it valuable in treating psoriasis, where it enhances corticosteroid delivery and reduces erythema and scaling. In acne, PEG-based salicylic acid peels offer controlled exfoliation with minimal irritation. PEG's hydrating properties also benefit ichthyosis and wound healing by maintaining moisture and delivering antibacterial agents. In cosmetics, PEG functions as an emulsifier, surfactant, and conditioner. However, hypersensitivity risks, including urticaria and anaphylaxis, require cautious use, especially for allergy-prone individuals. PEG's properties make it a useful dermatological component, though awareness of hypersensitivity risks is essential for safe clinical use. Further studies are needed to understand PEG-induced hypersensitivity and to guide safety protocols."

However, there is a lack of head-to-head studies on the choice of topical and systemic therapies for moderate to severe AD in the pediatric age group. This systematic review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of topical and systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe AD in the pediatric age group.

Thirty-four articles discussed topical therapies, which included corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and emollients, and 34 articles were about systemic therapies, consisting of cyclosporine, dupilumab, upadacitinib, thymopentin, omalizumab, antihistamines, probiotics, and others. Out of 68 studies, 41 were randomized controlled trials. Based on the study results, we conclude that topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors are effective and safe in mild to moderate pediatric AD. It was also demonstrated that while systemic monotherapy with dupilumab (in age groups younger than 6 months) and JAK inhibitors (like abrocitinib and upadacitinib in those younger than 12 years) is highly effective in rapidly reducing severity scores, their high cost and limited availability restrict their use in countries like India. In such settings, cyclosporine (and sometimes oral prednisolone in tapering doses over 2 weeks) is still recommended as a first-line therapy in severe AD while planning for steroid-sparing agents."

This cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted among all MBBS students studying in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Puducherry. The questionnaire was reviewed by dermatologists and pharmacologists for face and content validity, and internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's alpha, which was found to be reliable (0.73). The pretested, content-validated questionnaire, which included demographic details of the participants, the nature and type of cosmetics used, adverse reactions (if any) experienced by them, and awareness of cosmetovigilance, was shared along with the informed consent form and participant information sheet via Google Forms. Responses were obtained from the participants. Of the 600 eligible students, 246 participated, resulting in a response rate of 41%. The most commonly used cosmetics among participants were skin cleansing products, hair and scalp cleansing products, and tooth care products, respectively. Among the respondents, 71.4% (n=178) were aware that cosmetic products may cause adverse events, and 49.59% (n=122) had experienced adverse events following the use of cosmetics. Only 27.6% (n=68) of students were aware of the term cosmetovigilance. The majority became aware of the term through social media (17.5%, n=43). Among all participants, 42.2% (n=105) expressed willingness to report adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of cosmetics in the future by filling out an ADR reporting form. Given the low awareness of cosmetovigilance among medical students, integrating it into the medical curriculum is essential to enhance future healthcare professionals' role in patient safety. Future studies should focus on assessing reporting barriers, awareness gaps among dermatologists, and differences in knowledge between medical students and the general public."

A total 57 participants were recruited, with 27 and 30 in the test and bilastine alone group respectively. The combination of Histaglobulin with bilastine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy compared to bilastine alone. By Week 6, the Histaglobulin group achieved an 89.9% reduction in UAS versus 59.4% in the bilastine alone group (p < 0.01), with faster symptom resolution observed from Week 2. Laboratory findings showed notable reductions in serum IgE and AEC in the Histaglobulin group, suggesting enhanced modulation of allergic responses. No adverse effects were reported, highlighting the therapy's safety. The addition of Histaglobulin to bilastine provides a superior and well-tolerated treatment option for CSU, delivering faster symptom relief and better disease control. These findings support its use as an effective adjunctive therapy, warranting further investigation in larger sample size studies."

Cytopathological analysis focused on the presence of granulomas, histiocytic clusters, lymphocyte depletion, and necrosis, which aided in diagnosis. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Out of 279 patients, 178 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis and 90 with tuberculosis. Adequate TBNA samples were obtained in 240 cases, predominantly from male patients. Negative tuberculin skin tests and negative culture studies were significant findings in the sarcoidosis cases (p<0.0001). Echotexture and necrosis were distinguishing features of tuberculosis, while granulomas and histiocyte patterns varied. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing sarcoidosis via cytomorphology were notable, particularly when combined with negative microbiological findings. Cytomorphological analysis via EBUS-TBNA significantly aids in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, despite overlapping features with tuberculosis. The absence of necrosis and distinctive granuloma characteristics contribute to its high sensitivity and specificity. Radiological correlations and microbiological findings further enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluation in intrathoracic lymphadenopathies, highlighting the pivotal role of EBUS-TBNA in tuberculosis-endemic regions."

Out of a total of four visits, treatment led to significant improvement within 2 weeks, near-complete resolution after 3 weeks, and the patient was completely asymptomatic at the fourth visit. He was followed for the next year. One-year follow-up, including biweekly visits (first month), monthly telephone updates (next 5 months), and bimonthly updates (final 6 months), revealed no symptom relapse. This case highlights two key takeaways - the potential of personalized Ayurvedic approaches for managing treatment-resistant drug-induced dermatitis and achieving long-term remission through integrative strategies in complex dermatological cases. This case underscores the need for further research into the role of traditional medicine in managing challenging skin disorders and maintaining prolonged symptom-free periods."

Patients with ABPA, AS, or raised Aspergillus-specific IgG demonstrated more severe disease, with worse lung function and more frequent exacerbations at baseline. During long-term follow-up, patients with raised Aspergillus-specific IgG experienced higher exacerbation frequency and more severe exacerbations. AS was associated with increased exacerbations and hospitalizations only in patients not receiving inhaled corticosteroids. Aspergillus lung disease is common in bronchiectasis. Raised IgG levels to Aspergillus were associated with significantly worse outcomes, whereas ABPA and AS were associated with severe disease and exacerbations with a risk that is attenuated by inhaled corticosteroid use."

Most commonly, SPLIS patients exhibited lymphopenia and T cell-specific lymphopenia, consistent with the established role of the S1P/S1P1/SPL axis in lymphocyte egress. However, low B and NK cell counts, hypogammaglobulinemia, and opportunistic infections with bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens were observed. Diminished responses to childhood vaccinations were less frequently observed. Screening blood tests quantifying recent thymic emigrants identified some lymphopenic SPLIS patients in the newborn period. Lymphopenia has been reported to improve after cofactor supplementation in some SPLIS patients, indicating upregulation of SPL activity. A variety of treatments including immunoglobulin replacement, prophylactic antimicrobials and special preparation of blood products prior to transfusion have been employed in SPLIS. The diverse immune consequences in SPLIS patients suggest that aberrant S1P signaling may not fully explain the extent of immunodeficiency.

Moreover, our findings indicate that CA activates THP-1 cells co-stimulatory surface marker (CD86) via the activation of intracellular ROS, phagocytosis, and genes of the TLR4 pathway. These insights into the mechanisms uncovered by our study are crucial for managing triggers of allergic skin diseases caused by fragrance use and concurrent exposure to environmental UVB/sunlight."
Unveiling a Rare Phenomenon: Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss Following Skin Prick Testing.,2024,"['Arshit Kataria', 'Kangan']",pubmed,"The skin prick test (SPT) is a standard method for diagnosing allergic diseases, while sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) remains a perplexing condition often of unknown etiology.

This review discusses these dyes in details along with their detrimental effects on aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna including human beings. Azo dyes degrade the water bodies by increasing biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. Therefore, dye-containing wastewater should be effectively treated using eco-friendly and cost-effective technologies to avoid negative impact on the environment. This article extensively reviews on physical, chemical and biological treatment with their benefits and challenges. Biological-based treatment with higher hydraulic retention time (HRT) is economical, consumes less energy, produces less sludge and environmentally friendly. Whereas the physical and chemical methods with less hydraulic retention time is costly, produces large sludge, requires high dissolved oxygen and ecologically inefficient. Since, biological treatment is more advantageous over physical and chemical methods, researchers are concentrating on bioremediation for eliminating harmful azo dye pollutants from nature. This article provides a thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art biological treatment technologies with their developments and effectiveness in the removal of azo dyes. The mechanism by which genes encoding azoreductase enzymes (azoG, and azoK) enable the natural degradation of azo dyes by bacteria and convert them into less harmful compounds is also extensively examined. Therefore, this review also focuses on the use of genetically modified microorganisms and nano-technological approaches for bioremediation of azo dyes."
